# The Totes Best Magpie Bot

### Program Highlights/Description

Basically, it uses a Python back end to run the bot using some machine learning tactics like NLP and forwards it through to the Java front end :smiley:! So it uses API calls to a server which then spits out a response based on the inputs of others before. It then saves the input into a `database.db` for future processing.
